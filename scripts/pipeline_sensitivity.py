"""
End-to-end pipeline sensitivity: how many injected signals reach a human's eyes?

Every injection-recovery benchmark in this project so far
(``scripts/inject_recover.py``, the topk_frac sweeps, the teacher comparisons)
measures the **scorer**: does the injected snippet's scalar score clear a
robust sigma threshold? That is not the question the search result rests on.
Between the score and a plot a human actually looks at sit four more stages,
each of which can silently drop a real signal:

    score  ->  FAR 1% cut  ->  frequency-adjacency clustering
           ->  OFF-noise ceiling + full_row_hits short list

This script injects ON-only narrowband signals into real heldout cadences and
reports the survival fraction at **every** stage, so the search can be written
up with a sensitivity statement ("complete to X% at SNR Y") rather than an
unquantified absence of detections.

The plot cap is reported too, but as a *rank distribution* rather
than a filter: it is a review-budget knob (how many plots to render), not a
pipeline decision, and can simply be raised. What the rank tells us is how
much human review budget a given completeness costs.

It is deliberately cheap. It does not re-scan anything: the background score
pool for each cadence comes from the completed run's ``inference_scores.csv``
(via the ``_scores`` cache built by ``scripts/recompute_anomaly_maps.py``), and
the OFF-noise ceiling comes from that script's saved probe maps. The only work
per cadence is one HDD load plus a few hundred forward passes on injected
windows, so the whole sweep is hours, not the ~30 h a real rescan costs.

Two stages deserve a note on why they are measured rather than assumed:

* **The FAR 1% cut runs before any ON/OFF reasoning.** It keeps the top 1% of
  ~131k snippets by fused score, and that score is known to rank *persistent*
  signals above ON-only ones (occupancy AUC 0.36-0.40, see
  ``udma_component_attribution_result`` in memory). So the pipeline's first
  irreversible cut is structurally biased against exactly the class of signal
  the search targets. ``--loose_quantile`` re-runs the same cascade at a looser
  cut so the cost of the 1% choice is a measured number.
* **The short list is where the real decision happens.** Everything above it is
  a threshold on the model's own score; ``full_row_hits`` is the only stage
  that reasons about ON vs OFF, and by the attribution result it carries 100%
  of the ETI-vs-RFI discrimination. If a stage is going to lose signals, this
  is the one to watch.
