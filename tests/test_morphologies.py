"""Morphology injectors: ON-only semantics and in-band containment.

The containment tests are the load-bearing ones. setigen's non-linear paths take
a coefficient evaluated over the cadence's absolute timeline, so an
under-constrained parameterisation sweeps the signal straight out of the window
and every downstream sensitivity number silently becomes "no signal present"
rather than "signal not detected" — a failure that looks exactly like a real
negative result. See the module docstring of src/data/morphologies.py.
