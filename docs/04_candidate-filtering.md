# Candidate filtering — thresholds, ON/OFF logic, and short-list rules

Rationale behind `src/search/candidates.py`. The code there carries API
documentation only; the reasoning, the hand-validated numbers, and the
explicitly rejected alternatives live here.

## 1. Geometry: why grid rows map to observations

UDMA's `(6, 64)` feature grid comes from a `(16, 16)` patch over the
`(96, 1024)` input — one grid row per 16-row observation. Grid rows therefore
correspond 1:1, in order, to the 6 observations of a standard ABACAD cadence
(ON, OFF, ON, OFF, ON, OFF). Every ON/OFF rule below is built on that mapping.

A real target-locked signal scores high on ON rows and low on OFF rows;
persistent RFI scores similarly on both.

## 2. Spatial deduplication (`cluster_candidates`)

`scripts/inference.py` scans each cadence with overlapping windows
(`stride_infer < fchans`), so one wide or strong line trips many adjacent
windows above threshold. `cluster_candidates` groups them into one candidate
per contiguous run, keeping the peak-scoring snippet — a 1-D
connected-component grouping on the frequency axis.

This is the "spatial deduplication" stage of Phase 3. It is **pure
deduplication of the model's own score, with no new discriminating logic**: it
does not decide RFI vs. technosignature, it only collapses duplicate detections
of the same event into one entry.

The pattern is ported from the sibling `rst` project
(`rst_seti.inference.engine.InferenceEngine.cluster_detections`), which used
the same sliding-window geometry (snippet width 1024 channels, stride 512) but
applied it to a binary ETI/RFI probability instead of a continuous score.

## 3. The detection threshold: why a Gaussian 3σ threshold was replaced

**Problem (2026-07-14).** The GBT short list came back as pure noise. The cause
was the threshold, not the model: a Gaussian `median + 3*MAD_sigma` threshold
computed over the pooled score distribution sat *below* the OFF-row noise
ceiling.

Hand-validated on cad02:

| Quantity | Value |
|---|---|
| Gaussian 3σ threshold (`thresh_3`) | **0.16** |
| Real OFF-row noise ceiling | **~0.9** |
| Raw 0.999 quantile of pooled OFF values | **~31** |

The Gaussian threshold is an order of magnitude below the real noise ceiling —
MAD is supposed to be robust, but once RFI dominates the pool it is pulled
down by the very contamination it is meant to resist.

**Rejected alternative: a raw high quantile of the OFF values.** That goes too
far the other way — it is dominated by the RFI tail (~31 above), so it would
discard any candidate that RFI does not outshine.

**Adopted: `off_noise_ceiling`.** OFF-target rows carry no target signal by
construction, so any high value there is noise or RFI, never a real detection.
The function iteratively 3σ-clips the pooled OFF values (median/MAD, the same
scheme as `bandpass_correct`) to isolate the **noise core**, then takes a high
quantile of the surviving core. This lands at the real ceiling (~0.9) rather
than the noise floor (0.16) or the RFI tail (31).

Sanity check on the same run: cad02's candidate count decays 332 → 4 → 1 → 0
as the filter chain tightens, which is the correct answer for Orion (no
expected signal).

### 3.1 Known scale limitation

The `thresh_5` short-list floor was validated only at Voyager scale
(~2046 snippets/cadence, ~15% band coverage). At full-band Exotica scale
(~1000 clusters/cadence) the multiple-comparisons burden is far higher and
HIP114176-style false positives reappear. This is a **threshold-scale bug, not
a model bug**, and is fixable post-hoc from the saved CSVs without re-running a
scan.

Relatedly, `off_ceiling_probe` defaults to 300, tuned on the narrowband Voyager
file. On real full-band Exotica cadences that is only ~0.2% coverage — scale it
to ~2000–3000 for production runs.

## 4. `on_off_contrast` — ranking diagnostic

Reports mean-ON / mean-OFF for one snippet. Two design points:

**Why per-row hit counts exist.** ON-mean vs OFF-mean alone cannot distinguish
"present in every ON pointing" from "one transient that happened to land inside
a single ON block". A single-scan RFI burst produces a high contrast too —
observed 2026-07-06, where the top-contrast SRT candidate was a broadband
feature confined to one ON block and absent from the other two.
`n_on_hits`/`n_off_hits` count how many *individual* rows independently clear
the per-cadence threshold, so a genuine target-locked signal must hit most ON
rows and no OFF rows.

**Why a column window.** The search runs over a small column window around the
peak column rather than the exact column, tolerating a few channels of drift
between observations taken minutes apart.

This function is a **pure diagnostic**: it computes numbers and ranks plots. It
never thresholds or discards anything — that decision stays with the human
reviewer.

## 5. `full_row_hits` — short-list volume reduction

Separate from `on_off_contrast`, which still drives plot ranking.

**Why the column restriction is dropped.** `on_off_contrast`'s `col_window` is
anchored to a single peak column shared by all 6 rows. A fast or non-linear
drifter that shifts columns block-to-block falls outside that window and is
misread as OFF-absent — documented case: a satellite-like chirp visible in all
6 blocks scored `n_off_hits=0`. `full_row_hits` takes each row's own max over
the whole frequency axis, trading that blind spot for a different one (an
unrelated OFF-row event anywhere in the snippet's span now counts as a hit).

Used **only** to decide short-list membership (shown for manual vetting vs.
kept in the full CSV), never for ranking and never as a silent discard.

**Short-list rule.** `n_on_hits_full >= 2` AND not `off_leak`, where `off_leak`
requires ≥2 OFF rows to clear `threshold` *and* reach at least `leak_frac`
(default 0.3) of the weakest ON row's peak.

**Why the magnitude gate.** Added 2026-07-16 after a real-signal check: the
genuine Voyager-1 carrier (`on_off_contrast` 32×) was binary-rejected by two
low-amplitude OFF blips averaging ~3% of the ON magnitude. The gate stops
barely-above-threshold OFF noise from killing an otherwise overwhelming
candidate. Persistent RFI and fast chirps — the cases this filter exists to
catch — still trip `off_leak`, because their OFF-row magnitude is comparable to
their own ON-row magnitude, not merely above the noise floor.

### 5.1 Rejected: column-coherence gate

Proposed 2026-07-16: require each row's hit to land near the strongest ON row's
peak column. **Rejected on the arithmetic.**

At this product's grid resolution (~45 Hz/column) and with ~600 s between ON
blocks, even the project's *median* drift rate (0.3 Hz/s) shifts the peak by
~4 columns block-to-block:

```
0.3 Hz/s × 600 s = 180 Hz ≈ 4 columns
```

A tight column tolerance would therefore silently reject genuine drifting
technosignatures — precisely this pipeline's stated differentiator over
narrowband-only turboSETI. The trade was: a handful of visually-obvious noise
blips (cheap for a human reviewer to dismiss) in exchange for **silent false
negatives on the exact signals being searched for**. Not worth it.

## 6. Where the short list actually loses candidates

Measured 2026-07-21 over 280k heldout candidates: **73% die at the `off_ceiling`
gate before the ON/OFF logic engages at all.** The accepted short list has a
median ON/OFF contrast of only 1.21, which is why §3.1's scale limitation
matters more than any refinement to §4–§5.

Two clarifications that earlier versions of this section got wrong, both
settled by the full 364-cadence audit in
[`06_threshold-audit.md`](06_threshold-audit.md):

- **The stage is `off_ceiling`; the term is `thresh_5`.** `off_ceiling` is
  `max(off_noise_ceiling(probe), thresh_5)`, and across all 364 cadences the
  `max` is *always* won by `thresh_5`. So the 73% figure is about the gate, not
  about the OFF-noise ceiling proper — which has never once been the binding
  term. Do not read "73% die at the OFF-noise ceiling" as evidence that the
  OFF-noise machinery is doing the rejecting; it is inert in production.
- **`off_ceiling` does not dominate FAR@1% everywhere.** On 32.7% of cadences
  (119/364) `far_thresh` sits *above* `off_ceiling` — median 3.1x, max 162x —
  so on that third the top-1% pre-cut, not the ceiling, is the binding and
  signal-killing constraint. The earlier unconditional claim came from a
  150-cadence partial run and is superseded.
