## Motivation

Traditional SETI searches rely on matched-filter algorithms like [turboSETI](https://github.com/UCBerkeleySETI/turbo_seti), which are optimized for narrowband drifting signals. However, a genuine technosignature could have any morphology — wideband, pulsed, modulated, or transient. Searching for every possible signal type individually is impractical.

This project extends the autoencoder-based approach of [Ma et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12670) to search for a **broader range of technosignature-like signals**. Instead of using a supervised classifier (ContrastiveVAE + Random Forest) tied to known signal classes, we use an **unsupervised autoencoder** trained on real noise and RFI. Signals with anomalous morphology produce high reconstruction error and are flagged as candidates — no prior signal model required.

The search targets "exotica" sources: rare, extreme, or unusual astrophysical objects that expand SETI target lists beyond traditional nearby-star surveys.

## Method

A convolutional autoencoder learns the distribution of normal radio telescope data (noise + RFI). At inference, each spectrogram snippet is reconstructed by the model; the **reconstruction error** serves as the anomaly score. Snippets that the model cannot faithfully reconstruct are flagged as candidates for further inspection.

### Model Backbones

Five backbone architectures are available, selected by config. The first three share a CNN conv stack:

| Backbone | Config | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Autoencoder** | `convae.yaml` | Deterministic CNN AE. Full reconstruction error. Comparison baseline. |
| **CNN-MAE** | `convae_mae.yaml` | CNN Masked Autoencoder. Masks ~75% of patches during training, loss on masked positions only. Addresses the "too-good reconstruction" failure mode on locally-regular signals. |
| **VAE** | `convae_vae.yaml` | Variational AE. Reconstruction + beta*KL. Optional ablation variant. |
| **MemAE** | `memae.yaml` | Memory-augmented AE (Gong et al. 2019). A content-addressable memory of learned normal prototypes sits between encoder and decoder, so the decoder can only reconstruct from normal prototypes — anomalies (e.g. a narrowband line a plain AE would just copy through) get redrawn as normal and surface as reconstruction residual. |
| **ViT-MAE** | `vit_mae.yaml` | Vision Transformer Masked Autoencoder (SSAST-style). Patch tokenization + Transformer encoder, token masking during training, partitioned reconstruction at inference. |
| **UDMA** | `udma.yaml` | Unsupervised Distillation and Memory-enhanced AE (Qi et al. 2024) — current primary architecture. A frozen, self-supervised ViT-MAE teacher (read at an intermediate transformer block) supplies a token-feature target that two CNN "students" (one plain, one memory-augmented) are trained to regress. Anomaly score = student disagreement on the teacher's feature grid, not pixel reconstruction — there is no pixel decoder. |

The best-performing backbone per data product is selected empirically via injection-recovery testing. No classifier is trained — all backbones are scored purely by reconstruction/disagreement error (`compute_loss` for training, `anomaly_score`/`anomaly_map` for search-time scoring — see `src/models/autoencoder.py`).

## Pipeline Phases

1. **Unsupervised training** — the autoencoder learns the noise/RFI distribution from real telescope data
2. **Injection-recovery test** — synthetic signals (narrowband, wideband, broadband transient) are injected at varying SNR to characterize detection sensitivity
3. **Search** — the pipeline is applied to Exotica catalog observations; high-reconstruction-error frames are flagged as candidates and later cross-referenced with turboSETI output

## GBT Data Products

HDF5 filterbank files (`.h5`) at three resolution levels, each targeting a different signal class:

| Suffix | Freq. resolution | Time resolution | Target signal class |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| `0000.fil` | ~3 Hz/chan | ~18 s/bin | Narrowband drifting |
| `0001.fil` | ~364 kHz/chan | ~349 us/bin | Broadband transients |
| `0002.fil` | ~2.86 kHz/chan | ~1 s/bin | Wideband / modulated |

Observations follow an ABACAD cadence pattern (3 ON-source + 3 OFF-source), each ~308 s in duration.

## Installation

### With conda (recommended)

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate platypus
pip install -e .
```

On a CUDA-equipped machine, install the appropriate PyTorch build first:

```bash
pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
```

### With pip only

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

**Requirements:** Python >= 3.10, PyTorch >= 2.2, PyTorch Lightning >= 2.2

Key dependencies: `setigen` (synthetic signal generation), `blimpy` (filterbank I/O), `h5py`, `astropy`, `scikit-learn`, `pytorch-msssim`.

### Data paths

A few paths are specific to the machine hosting the GBT data and must be
pointed at your own storage before anything will run:

- `configs/data/gbt_fine.yaml` → `dataset.cache_dir` (directory holding
  `train.npy`, `val.npy`, `meta.json`, produced by `scripts/preprocess_cache.py`)
- `scripts/debug/exotica_dist_analysis.py` → `DATA_DIR` (raw `.h5` batch)
- The exploration notebooks under `notebooks/` read the raw batch directly

Usage examples in docstrings use `/path/to/...` placeholders throughout.

## Usage

### Training

```bash
# Training config bundles a data + model config (see configs/training/*.yaml)
python scripts/train.py --config configs/training/udma_gbt_fine.yaml
```

Outputs (checkpoints, logs, reconstruction snapshots) are saved to `outputs/<run_id>/`.

UDMA additionally requires an offline teacher feature normalization pass before training
(computes per-channel mu/sigma over the training set, stored under `outputs/udma_teacher_norm/`
and referenced by `configs/model/udma.yaml: teacher.norm_stats`):

```bash
python scripts/fit_udma_teacher_norm.py --config configs/training/udma_gbt_fine.yaml
```

### Inference

Run the trained model on real cadences to score each frequency window:

```bash
python scripts/inference.py \
    --checkpoint outputs/training/<run>/checkpoints/best.ckpt \
    --cadence_list data/processed/inference_cadences.txt \
    --data_config configs/data/gbt_fine.yaml \
    --model_config configs/model/udma.yaml \
    --out_dir outputs/inference/run_name \
    --num_workers 32
```

Each cadence gets its own output folder with per-candidate plots (original | reconstruction | error map).

### Injection-Recovery

Evaluate detection sensitivity by injecting synthetic signals directly into clean cadences
(the script builds its own RFI background in-process — no separate inference pass needed first):

```bash
python scripts/inject_recover.py \
    --checkpoint outputs/training/<run>/checkpoints/best.ckpt \
    --cadence_list data/processed/inject_recovery_cadences.txt \
    --data_config configs/data/gbt_fine.yaml \
    --model_config configs/model/udma.yaml \
    --out_dir outputs/inject_recovery/run_name
```

### CLI Commands

After `pip install -e .`, the following commands are available system-wide:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `bl-train` | Training entry point |
| `bl-inference` | Run inference on real cadences |
| `bl-inject` | Injection-recovery sensitivity test |
| `bl-preprocess` | Build preprocessed snippet cache |
| `bl-manifest` | Build cadence manifest from raw data (`scripts/build_cadence_manifest.py`; see also `scripts/build_gbt_cadence_manifest.py` for stratified per-target GBT splits, no console entry point yet) |

Each accepts the same arguments as the corresponding `python scripts/...` invocation. For example:

```bash
bl-train --config configs/training/default.yaml
bl-inference --checkpoint outputs/training/<run>/checkpoints/best.ckpt \
             --cadence_list data/processed/inference_cadences.txt \
             --out_dir outputs/inference/run_name
```

## Documentation

Code carries API documentation only. The reasoning behind the design — rejected
alternatives, hand-validated numbers, and experiments worth not repeating —
lives in [`docs/`](docs/README.md).

| Document | Covers |
|---|---|
| [`01_scoring-history.md`](docs/01_scoring-history.md) | **Start here.** Why reconstruction error fails, and the five scorer families that failed before UDMA |
| [`02_udma-architecture.md`](docs/02_udma-architecture.md) | The production model, its pre-registered acceptance bars, and how it relates to Qi et al. 2024 |
| [`03_teacher-localization.md`](docs/03_teacher-localization.md) | Why the teacher is domain-matched, and the three refuted hypotheses behind that choice |
| [`04_candidate-filtering.md`](docs/04_candidate-filtering.md) | Detection thresholds, the OFF-noise ceiling, ON/OFF short-list rules |
| [`05_results.md`](docs/05_results.md) | Validation results and known limitations |

## Design Choices

- **Framework:** PyTorch + PyTorch Lightning. Models are plain `nn.Module`s; a thin `LightningModule` wrapper handles optimization, checkpointing, and multi-GPU training. Hardware selection (CPU / 1-GPU / 2-GPU, mixed precision) is config-driven with zero code branching.
- **Preprocessing:** two-stage, applied online per snippet. Stage 1: bandpass correction (polynomial fit to per-channel temporal median, with iterative sigma-clipping to exclude RFI). Stage 2: `log1p` compression + robust median/MAD standardization.
- **Reproducibility:** seed applied via Lightning `seed_everything`; every run directory is tagged with a timestamp and git hash.
- **Current architecture direction:** UDMA (teacher-student feature distillation, see above) is the primary scorer under active development, following five prior scorer families (recon-MSE, latent-density, GMM, dist384, MLP-probe) that failed to beat trivial energy statistics. A zero-training pixel-space probe (`‖AE(x) − MemAE(x)‖²` disagreement) validated the teacher-student disagreement mechanism before the full UDMA build; see `scripts/debug/` for the diagnostic scripts behind these decisions.
