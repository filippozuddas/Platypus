Candidate post-processing: deduplication, ON/OFF diagnostics, short-list rules.

Operates on UDMA's ``(6, 64)`` anomaly map, whose rows correspond 1:1, in
order, to the 6 observations of an ABACAD cadence (ON, OFF, ON, OFF, ON, OFF).

    OFF-target rows carry no target signal by construction, so any high value

    the noise core, then takes ``quantile`` of the surviving core.

    Replaces a Gaussian ``median + 3*MAD_sigma`` threshold; a raw high quantile
    of the unclipped values is not a valid substitute either. See
